# üèóÔ∏è Regendary Bets - Encrypted Prediction Markets on TON

**The Privacy-Preserving SocialFi Platform Revolutionizing Prediction Markets**

## üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional prediction markets face a critical limitation: **the observer effect kills alpha**. When users submit early insights to seed prediction markets, their profitable strategies become immediately visible to competitors, arbitrage bots, and market manipulators. This transparency paradox means that the most valuable early signals - from the smartest predictors - are systematically withheld, resulting in poorly seeded markets with less accurate pricing.

### The Core Dilemma
- **Early movers get front-run**: Smart money refuses to seed markets when their strategies are transparent
- **Social insights go untapped**: Telegram communities hold massive predictive power but won't expose their alpha
- **Market manipulation thrives**: Transparent positioning enables coordinated attacks on emerging predictions
- **Liquidity fragmentation**: Fear of front-running leads to splintered, illiquid prediction markets

## üí° Our Solution: FHE-Powered Encrypted Seeding

Regendary Bets leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to solve the transparency paradox. We built infrastructure on TON that enables Telegram users to **seed prediction markets with encrypted insights** - contributing valuable alpha without revealing their strategies until market resolution.

### üîê Technical Architecture

#### FHE Infrastructure (`/fhe`)
- **Encrypted computation engine** built with TFHE-rs
- **Key generation system** for secure client/server key pairs
- **Homomorphic operations** on encrypted prediction data
- **State management** for tracking encrypted market positions

#### TON Mini App Integration
- **TonConnect-ready hooks** for seamless TON wallet integration
- **Telegram Mini App** for intuitive mobile-first experience
- **Real-time prediction market data** with encrypted seeding
- **SocialFi features** leveraging Telegram's network effects

#### Key Capabilities
- **Encrypted market seeding**: Users submit encrypted probability assessments
- **Homomorphic aggregation**: Combine encrypted signals without decryption
- **Privacy-preserving payouts**: Determine winnings without revealing positions
- **Cross-user reputation**: Build track records without exposing strategies

## üöÄ How It Works

### Phase 1: Encrypted Insight Collection
```
1. User connects Telegram ‚Üí TON wallet
2. Submits encrypted prediction (e.g., "BTC > $100k by EOY: 73% confidence")
3. FHE system processes without revealing underlying data
4. Market receives homomorphic aggregate of all insights
```

### Phase 2: Market Seeding & Pricing
```
1. Smart contracts receive encrypted probability distributions
2. FHE engine computes optimal market parameters
3. Markets launch with superior pricing from encrypted signals
4. No individual user strategy is ever exposed
```

### Phase 3: Resolution & Settlement
```
1. Outcome becomes publicly verifiable
2. FHE system decrypts only the aggregate position data
3. Individual payouts calculated without exposing strategies
4. Users build reputation scores for future markets
```
